<p class="p1b">CHEMICAL CHANGES PRODUCED BY COOKING</p>

<p>The application of heat to food is comparatively of recent origin
in the evolution of mankind. The use of fire involves a certain amount
of mental ingenuity, and could not be practised by man's anthropoid
ancestors. Anthropoid animals, whether human or ape, have a great
amount of curiosity for the unusual and the new.</p>

<p>Man probably began his cooking experiments by soaking hard foods
in warm water, then in hot water, or by warming cold foods at his
camp-fire. As heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
volatilizes the pleasant odorous substance present in many foods, the
custom of heating them probably became popular. The habit of cooking
spread, as many other novel and interesting customs have spread, from
this primitive process to the French chef, regardless of whether the
results were beneficial or harmful.</p>

<p>The question whether foods should be eaten cooked or uncooked can
best be answered by examining the chemical and mechanical changes
produced in the process of cooking, and their consequent physiological
effects.</p>

<p>Cooking may be divided into two classes, namely, <span
class="smcap">Moist Heat</span> and <span class="smcap">Dry
Heat</span>. To illustrate:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of heat on sugars</div>

<p>Sugars are not chemically affected by boiling with water, while
starch, cooked with boiling water, or steam, absorbs from three to
five times its bulk of moisture, and changes into a soft, pasty, or
semi-dissolved mass. Under dry heat, sugars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
are converted into a brown substance, known as caramel, while starch
cooked under a temperature of 300&deg; to 400&deg; of dry heat, is changed into
a dextrin, of which toast and zwieback are examples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of heat on fats</div>

<p>Fats are not changed chemically by moist heat; that is, by being
boiled in water, but the globules are melted and the hot fat spreads in
a film over other material which may be present. In dry heat, fats are
chemically decomposed, forming irritating vapors. The odors of frying
fat are due to the presence of small quantities of these decomposition
products. In larger quantities, and with greater heat, these substances
are exceedingly irritating to the mucous membrane of the stomach and
the intestines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of heat on proteids</div>

<p>The chemical changes produced by heating proteids are of much more
importance than are those which take place in other foods. Simple
proteids, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
as albumin and globulin, are coagulated at a temperature of about
160&deg;. This change is familiar in the coagulation of egg whites
under low temperature. Other proteids undergo similar changes,
governed by the degree and kind of heat (dry or moist), to which
they are subjected. This change in proteid material continues with
the application of prolonged heat, until the proteid, under dry
heat, is converted into a dark brittle mass, wholly insoluble and
indigestible.</p>

<p>If the student will take the white of an egg, and bake it for some
time in an oven, he will observe the coagulation or hardening of the
proteid. The chemical nature of this change is one of great complexity.
The molecules combine with each other, forming almost indestructible
substances. The combined or coagulated forms of proteid are represented
in nature by horns, hoofs, finger nails, and hair.</p>

<p class="p2">STARCH DIGESTION&mdash;COOKED AND UNCOOKED</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparative digestion of cooked and uncooked
grain</div>

<p>The student will remember the reference made in Lesson V to
experiments concerning the digestibility of starch when taken in
various forms. In these experiments, though conducted for the purpose
of demonstrating the supposed advantage of excessive cooking, the
results showed that at the time the contents of the stomach were
removed, all the proteids of the uncooked grain had been digested,
while the percentage of proteid digested from the various forms of
cooked grain grew less as the cooking was increased. As the chief
function of the gastric juice is the digestion of proteids, the real
significance of the above experiments was exactly the opposite from
that which was intended to be proved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons given for cooking starch</div>

<p>The statement is frequently made that
the starch of grain cannot be digested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
without cooking, because the cells enclosing the starch grains have
indigestible or insoluble cellulose walls. The old theory is that
cooking expands the starch and ruptures or tears down these walls,
freeing the contents so that the digestive juices may act upon the
enclosed starch granules. This is a theory unsupported by facts. The
cell walls on the interior of the grain kernel are very filmy, and in
the mature grain scarcely exist at all. The analysis of wheat flour
shows only a trace of cellulose fiber. Were these cellulose walls
within the wheat grain, as this theory commonly teaches, flour would
show a liberal quantity of cellulose. The cellulose wall theory, as a
necessity for cooking starch, is an excellent illustration of the ease
with which a groundless statement or theory may be used to prove or to
explain some popular prejudice.</p>

<p>In the process of cooking, the tendency
is to render the organic salts contained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
food entirely inorganic. This change from organic to inorganic salts
is measured by the temperature to which the foods are subjected. Many
of these salts are combined with the nitrogenous constituents of food,
therefore when subjected to certain degrees of heat they are of little
value in the construction of the proteid molecules within the body.
This is especially true of fresh or green vegetables.</p>


<p class="p2">EXCUSES FOR COOKING OUR FOOD</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ancestral habits not inherited</div>

<p>Inasmuch as the majority of people favor cooking, probably
forgetting that about half of the food consumed in the world at the
present time is taken in its natural or uncooked state, it may be
well to mention some of the views advanced by those who believe that
the present diet of cooked grain is better for modern man than an
elementary diet, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
attempt to give a natural explanation. One theory is that man has
subsisted so long upon cooked foods that his organs have become fitted
for a cooked diet, and a cooked diet only. Another view sometimes
advanced is, that while cooked foods were originally detrimental, yet
by continued use man has become fitted for such a diet and unfitted
for a natural diet. These are but other forms of the old belief in
the inheritance of acquired characteristics. This belief, however, is
steadily losing ground among evolutionists. There is no more reason to
believe that a modified function of the stomach would be inherited,
than there is to believe that small feet would be inherited among
the Chinese women just because these organs are mutilated by local
custom.</p>

<p>The best light of scientific knowledge now leads us to believe
that the healthy child of today is, in its capacity for nutrition,
essentially like the primitive child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
and would thrive best upon a varied diet of natural foods.</p>


<p class="p2">EXPERIMENT UPON ANIMALS</p>

<p>While I do not claim that the methods of animal feeding apply
accurately to man, yet the digestive and the assimilative processes of
animals are so closely related to the human processes, that the results
obtained in animal nutrition are very instructive to the student of
human food science.</p>

<p>About thirty years ago, when the scientific study of agriculture
first became prevalent, an experiment was made in cooked food for
animals, upon an extensive basis. At that time it was the universal
belief that man owed much of his superiority over other animals to the
use of cooked food. This argument was put forth with great force and
appeared quite reasonable. It was asked whether animals other than man would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
benefited by changing to a cooked bill of fare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Governmental experiments on cooked food for
animals</div>

<p>During this agitation numerous western farmers put their hogs,
chickens, cows, horses, and sheep upon a cooked bill of fare, and many
enthusiastic feeders claimed beneficial results. Later the various
Governmental Experimental Stations took up the subject and made many
careful, complete, and comparative tests of the effects of cooked and
uncooked food for animals. The result did not show the expected thing.
The cooking experiments in the majority of cases proved injurious, and
the general decision of the Government investigators was that cooking
food for animals was useless and detrimental to the great live stock
industry. Stock food cookery has now become entirely obsolete.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cooking a habit of civilization</div>

<p>Man is the only animal that cooks his
food, and has made great progress in
civilization while subsisting on a cooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
diet, but cooking is no more the cause of his advancement than silk
hats and swallow-tailed coats. He has advanced only according to the
degree that he has thought, studied, and experimented. Cooking has
undoubtedly enabled man to utilize many things as food, that he could
not and would not have used otherwise, but whether this has aided or
retarded in his material progress is yet an unsolved question.</p>


<p class="p2">FOOD COMBINATIONS</p>

<p>The following tables are designed to convey, in the most condensed
and simplified form, the results of my investigations in regard to food
combinations.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to give in any one table exact information
concerning food combinations under the varying conditions of the body
and its ever-changing requirements. The best that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
can be done is to lay out such groups as are fundamentally harmonious
from a chemical point of view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quantity an important factor</div>

<p>The particular condition of the patient often reveals certain
special requirements which must be dealt with according to the symptoms
given off by the body. Many of these combinations, when taken under
certain conditions, may appear disagreeable, but this can be overcome
by leveling the proportions and limiting the quantity. Quantity is of
very great importance for the reason that the most perfect selections
of food can be made and blended into perfect chemical harmony, and
still disagree with the normal stomach if a quantity is taken in excess
of physical demands.</p>

<p>The use of these tables will serve to bring to the student's
attention the advantage to be gained from a health-giving and curative
point of view, as well as from simplicity in diet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span></p>

<p>In considering the chemical harmony of foods, the student should
keep in mind the time required for digestion, which involves not only
the question of combining foods at the same meal, but also the taking,
within a few hours after eating, of other articles that may produce
chemical inharmony. For example: Milk, cereals, and sweet fruits are in
chemical harmony, but a lemonade introduced into the stomach an hour or
two later would produce inharmony, and be almost as harmful as if it
had been taken with the meal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Instinct a safe guide, if cultivated</div>

<p>There are many injurious combinations which the student will learn
to omit from a sense of taste and instinct, and while our instincts
have in many cases ceased to guide us aright, they will rapidly return
and assume command if given a fair opportunity.</p>

<p>The perfect meal can be made from
three or four articles, and the entire menu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
can be changed three times a day, but to take eight, ten, or a dozen
things at the same meal, puts the quantity, as well as every article
composing the meal, into jeopardy.</p>

<p>After one has eaten a sufficient quantity of food, and the taste
has signalled "ENOUGH," something sweet or pungent is introduced. This
puts into activity another set of taste buds which will accept a given
quantity of another food. However, the stomach has already given off
one signal of "enough," hence every pennyweight taken in excess of that
amount is that much more than should be eaten.</p>

<p>In order to simplify the making of harmonious combinations, I have
grouped the foods whose use I recommend in nine different divisions.
A further subdivision of vegetables and fruits might have been made,
but this would have increased the number of groups, making them more
complicated and less practical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">HOW TO INTERPRET THE TABLES</p>

<p>In order to ascertain the articles with which any special food will
combine, the student should turn to the table headed with the desired
article of that group. If foods from three groups are to be considered,
the student will look for two of them in the first vertical column on
the left-hand side of the page, and will then follow across to the
vertical column for the third article.</p>

<blockquote><p>Figure (1) means especially beneficial<br />
Figure (2) means good combinations<br />
Figure (3) means somewhat undesirable<br />
Figure (4) means particularly harmful<br /></p></blockquote>

<p>(a) "Fats with" figure (1), under the heading <em>Grains</em>, first table,
page 609, means that the combination of "fats with grains" would be
"especially beneficial."</p>

<p>(b) "Fats and eggs with" figure (2), under the heading <em>Milk</em>, page
609, means that "fats and eggs with milk" make a good combination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span></p>

<p>(c) "Fats and milk with" figure (3),
page 609, under column headed <em>Nuts</em>,
means a "somewhat undesirable" combination.</p>

<p>(d) "Fats and acid fruits with" figure
(4), under heading <em>Milk</em>, page 609, means
that this combination would be "particularly
harmful," etc.</p>

<p>It is impractical to print ready reference
tables showing the harmony of more than
three articles, but the student can judge
this sufficiently well for himself by comparing
the respective harmonies of the
several foods of the group.</p>

in all foods, yet they usually contain many
compounds which render them, from a
chemical standpoint, very difficult to
classify accurately. For example, the
principal nutrients in wheat are carbohydrates
(starch and sugar), yet wheat
contains mineral salts, fat, and protein,
the latter being a compound consisting of
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and
sulfur. Wheat would, therefore, be
placed in the carbohydrate class, but it
would overlap into several other classes.
What is true of wheat, is true of nearly
all other articles of food. Furthermore,
foods do not chemically reproduce themselves
when taken into the body, but in
the process of metabolism they are converted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
either into other elements or into
other compounds. From this it will be
understood that the articles listed under
the following headings are classified according
to the nutritive substance which
predominates in them, and are given for
the purpose of guiding the practitioner
in the selection of such foods as will
supply the various chemical constituents
of the body.</p>

<p>Foods which contain two or more
substances in generous proportions may
appear under two or more of the following
headings, as in the case of peanuts. This
humble article of food contains 19 per
cent carbohydrates, 20 per cent protein,
and 29 per cent fat, hence it is listed
under the three headings&mdash;carbohydrates,
proteids, and fats.</p>

<p>The tables comprise the best selections
of food available in all countries and at
all seasons of the year. They contain
everything the body needs under the
varying conditions of age, climate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
activity, except, perhaps, in some parts
of the frigid zone.</p>

<p>In compiling these tables I have selected
only such articles of food as
experience has proved most useful.</p>

<p class="p2">PURPOSES WHICH THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF
FOOD SERVE IN THE HUMAN BODY</p>

<p>While all the articles of food in the
four above-named classifications contain
other elements than the one under which
heading they appear, yet the body uses
or appropriates them for the following
purposes:</p>


<p class="p2">PURPOSE OF CARBOHYDRATES</p>

<p>The carbohydrate substance in food is
used by the body chiefly for the purpose
of keeping up body-weight; that is, for
the purpose of supplying the various
fluids which fill the cell-structure. If one
is suffering from emaciation, the carbohydrate
element in food should predominate.
While some of the more soluble
proteids, especially milk and eggs, will
give a rapid gain in weight, the weight
will not be permanent unless sufficient
carbohydrates are taken to supply the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
blood with all the required elements of
nutrition, or, in other words, to level or
to balance the body requirements.</p>


<p class="p2">PURPOSE OF FATS</p>

<p>Fats are used by the animal body
primarily for the purpose of producing
heat. Food is burned or oxidized in
the blood, undergoing very much the
same action as does the combustion of
coal in a grate. The heat thus generated
is delegated to the blood, and the blood,
by its circulation, distributes this heat
throughout the body. The carbon dioxid
or waste matter formed during the
circulation, is carried to the lungs, where
it reunites with the oxygen which we
breathe, and thereby again passes back
into the atmosphere.</p>


<p class="p2">PURPOSE OF PROTEIDS</p>

<p>Proteid is a compound containing
chiefly nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
Its purpose is to form the muscular and
the tissue structure of the body. To use
a homely illustration, proteid may be
compared to the material which makes
the honeycomb, while the carbohydrate
substance may be compared to the honey;
that is, to the fluids which fill the cells.</p>

<p>Those performing heavy or active muscular
labor should eat liberally of the
proteid class of foods.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions, natural hunger
will call for the quantity of proteid
needed. The tendency, however,
should be toward the minimum; that is,
one should take the lowest quantity of
proteid that the body requires to keep
up the cell-structure. (See Lesson VI,
p. 216.) Modern investigations have
shown that, in many cases of extreme
athletic tests, a low proteid diet has given
the greatest endurance. This is accounted
for by the fact that nearly all
carbohydrates, especially of the grain
family, contain from 8 to 12 per cent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
proteids, which is quite sufficient, in
many instances, to supply the body with
all the tissue-building material necessary.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the several nutritive elements
found in a single article of food are
better proportioned by Nature, than man
can usually proportion them, the relation
of one substance to another will be better
divided if the entire meal be made to
consist of only one kind of food, and both
digestion and assimilation will therefore
be more perfect. Under these conditions
the blood will be laden with very little
waste matter, which is the thing that
reduces our powers of endurance. Therefore,
when it is possible to secure the
carbohydrate, the proteid, and the fatty
substances from a single article of food
which will give to the body greater
strength and endurance than when we
secure these substances from several
sources, we should confine our menus
to single articles of well-proportioned
food. This thought, carried to its logical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
end, leads one more and more, as experience
progresses, toward the mono-diet
system.</p>


<p class="p2">PURPOSE OF MINERAL SALTS</p>

<p>Mineral salts serve two distinct purposes
in the body:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 They assist in building up the
cartilage and the body-structure</p>

<p>2 They assist in the digestion, and
in the dissolution of other
foods, especially of the carbohydrate
group, and more especially
of the grain family</p></blockquote>

<p>Grains are very difficult to subdivide
into their constituent elements; that is,
to reduce to a solution so fine that
assimilation will be perfect. A liberal
use of the foods containing mineral salts
aids very materially in this process of
solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIGESTIBILITY AND
ASSIMILABILITY</p>

<p>The true interpretation of the word
"digestion" is the preparation of food
by the action of:</p>

<blockquote><p>1 The saliva</p>
<p>2 The gastric juice</p>
<p>3 The bile, and</p>
<p>4 The pancreatic juice</p></blockquote>

<p>When food is properly prepared by
mastication by the time it reaches the
pancreas, it should be thoroughly split
up or subdivided, in which state it is
ready for assimilation.</p>

<p>The true interpretation of the word
"assimilation" is the absorption of all
food substances through the walls of the
intestinal tract, and the final passing
of them into the circulation.</p>

<p>It is nothing unusual, however, for a
person to become afflicted with predigestion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
and, at the same time, with
poor or faulty assimilation; in other
words, digestion being too rapid, and
assimilation being too slow. This condition
frequently occurs in cases of superacidity.
On account of the excess of
acid, the food digests or passes from the
stomach prematurely; that is, before it
has been dissolved by the action of the
hydrochloric acid. The food, thus super-charged
with acid, passes from the stomach
into the lower intestines, and sets
up a condition of irritation. This irritation
or swelling of the mucous surface
(lining) of the intestines, closes the small
canals, or winking valves, as they are
sometimes called, thus seriously interfering
with the passing of the dissolved
food matter into the circulation.</p>

<p>* While all the vegetables mentioned
in the above table belong to the carbohydrate
class, yet the starch element
contained in them is very much more
assimilable than the starch contained
in grains or legumes, therefore these
vegetables may be eaten freely by those
having rheumatic or gouty tendencies.</p>

<p>The starch and the sugar content in
fresh vegetables appears low owing to the
fact that they contain a large percentage
of water. Eliminating the water, these
foods rank in their starch and sugar
content with cereals and legumes, and
are much more easily digested and assimilated.
In other words, if the chemist
should reduce the water content to the
same per cent as that of cereals, the carbohydrate
content would rise in the same
ratio as the water content is reduced.
Both the starch and the sugar content
of these vegetables is more digestible, and
more readily assimilated than the starch
and the sugar found in cereals and
legumes.</p>

<p class="p2">PURPOSE OF THE VIENO TABLE</p>

<p>The student should remember that
not only the quantity but the quality of
food must be considered. The vieno
system of food measurement, as herein
explained, is the simplest system of food
measurement that has ever been published.
It is amply complete, and accurate
enough for the purpose for which it
is intended, and that is the calculation
of the energy and the available nitrogen
contained in natural dietaries.</p>

<p>This measurement is really a quantitative
measurement; that is, it measures
the quantity, not the quality. In order
to have a full knowledge of a bill of fare,
it is necessary to know, in addition to the
quantity, the exact chemical nature of
each particular food, and also to know
the other foods with which that food will
combine.</p>

<p>This food table tells accurately the
amount of energy that may be derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span>
from food by chemical analysis, but it
does not tell the amount of energy that
the body must expend in the work of
assimilation. This cannot be given in a
table, because it varies with the individual
and the condition of his digestive organs.</p>

<h2><a name="Lesson_XIV" id="Lesson_XIV"></a>LESSON XIV</h2>

<p class="p3">VIENO SYSTEM OF FOOD MEASUREMENT</p>


<p>The amount of nutrition contained in a
given quantity of food is often a determining
factor in curative dietetics.</p>

<p>The two most important things to be
considered in prescribing foods are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 The amount of energy contained
in a given quantity</p>

<p>2 The amount of available nitrogen
or tissue-building material
in a given quantity</p></blockquote>


<p class="p2">ENERGY</p>

<p>Energy is the power to do work. That
form of energy with which we are most
familiar is mechanical energy, as raising
a stone or turning a wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span></p>

<p>Heat is another form of energy. Heat
and work can be converted into each
other. The steam-engine turns heat into
work, while a "hot box" on a car-wheel is
a case of work being turned back into heat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amount of heat a food produces determines its
energy</div>

<p>Experience shows that a definite
amount of heat will yield a definite
amount of work, so that the
amount of heat produced by
a given amount of food,
when combined with oxygen,
is taken as a measure of its energy.
This is ordinarily expressed in calories, a
calorie being the amount of heat required
to raise the temperature of one thousand
grams of water one degree on the
centigrade thermometer scale.</p>

<p>The use of these terms need not concern
the student. Instead of using the calorie
I will use a unit which is equal to one
hundred calories. I have selected a unit
of this size because it gives about the
ordinary service of food at meals which
is easily measured and remembered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">NITROGEN</p>

<p>Nitrogen is the chemical element that
is most concerned with the function of
life. All animal tissue contains nitrogen,
which forms about one-sixth part, by
weight, of all the nitrogenous or protein
substances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proportion of
Nitrogen in
lean meat</div>

<p>If we were to take a hundred pounds
of lean meat, or muscle, and evaporate
from it all the water, we
would have about eighteen
pounds of dry material left.
If we should analyze this dry substance,
we would find that about one-sixth, or
three pounds, would be the element
nitrogen. Thus we say that muscle
contains eighteen per cent of protein, or
three per cent of nitrogen. In ordinary
practise the protein is mixed with fats
and salts, and cannot be measured by
simply drying out the water, so the chemist
finds the amount of nitrogen present
and multiplies by 6.25, which gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
about the correct per cent of protein.
This method is not exact because the
per cent of nitrogen in various proteids
is not always the same, but it will give
an intelligent average. I will discard the
use of the term protein, and refer to the
amount of nitrogen directly.</p>

<p>All compounds of the element nitrogen
are not available as food. For example:
The nitrogen of the air, of ammonia gas,
or gunpowder cannot be utilized in the
animal body. The nitrogen in foods
only refers to available nitrogen. Compounds
containing other forms of nitrogen
are not foods, but are frequently
poisons.</p>


<p class="p2">SYSTEMS OF FOOD MEASUREMENTS COMPARED</p>

<p class="p1">THE "OLD" SYSTEM</p>

<p>Under the old system of food measurement,
feeding the human body cannot be
made a practical science for the masses,
therefore a new system becomes necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
That we may more fully appreciate
the value of a new system, let us
consider the methods hitherto available.</p>

<p>Suppose a man is using two quarts of
milk a day, and wishes to determine
the amount of available nitrogen or
tissue-building material and energy it
contains. Under the old system he must
get a book on food analysis, or send to
Washington for a Government bulletin.
If he does not understand the meaning
of the terms and figures used, the tables
would be useless to him until he goes to a
chemist to have them explained. He is
now ready to work out the nutritive
value of his milk, and proceeds as follows:</p>

<p>First, he gets the number of cu cm
in the milk, thus&mdash;952.8 (number cu cm
in 1 quart) x 2 = 1905.6, number of cu cm
in 2 quarts of milk. Second, he gets the
weight of his milk in grams&mdash;1.032 (number
grams in 1 cu cm of milk) x 1905.6 =
1966.57, number of grams in 2 quarts of
milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span></p>

<p>He now turns to a table of analysis
which tells him that milk contains 3 per
cent of protein, 3&frac12; per cent of fat, and
4&frac12; per cent of sugar. As the amount of
nitrogen in milk is approximately one-sixth
of its entire protein, he would now
get 16 per cent of the 3 per cent (.16 x .03
= .0048), which is the percentage of
nitrogen contained in milk.</p>

<p>His next step would be&mdash;1966.57 (number
grams in 2 quarts of milk) x .0048 =
9.44, the number of grams of nitrogen
in 2 quarts of milk.</p>

<p>I will not explain the way in which the
energy would have to be figured, but will
merely give the arithmetical processes
by which the result is obtained:</p>


<p><span style="margin-left: 3.7em;">3&nbsp;</span> ×&nbsp; 4.1&nbsp; =&nbsp; 12.3<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">3.5&nbsp;</span> ×&nbsp; 9.3&nbsp; =&nbsp; 32.55<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">4.5&nbsp;</span> ×&nbsp; 4.1&nbsp; =&nbsp; 18.45<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">12.3&nbsp;</span> +&nbsp; 32.55 + 18.45 =&nbsp; 63.30<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">1966.57</span>&nbsp; ×&nbsp; 63.30 = 124483.88<br />
124483.88&nbsp; ÷  &nbsp;100  =&nbsp; 1244, the No. of calories or
energy (heat units) contained in two quarts of milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">THE NEW OR "VIENO" SYSTEM</p>

<div class="sidenote">Derivation of
the word Vieno</div>

<p>To a unit of food-energy which is equal
to one hundred calories (see last paragraph
on "Energy"), I have
given the name of <em>Vieno</em>,
derived from "vital" and
"energy," and pronounced <em>vi-eń-o</em>. The
Vieno system, therefore, will measure all
foods by vi-en-os, or units of energy equal
to one hundred of the chemist's calories.
One vieno of milk is one-sixth of a quart,
or two-thirds of an ordinary glass. From
this it is readily seen that two quarts of
milk will give twelve vienos of energy,
or, if we wish to express it in the chemist's
term, twelve hundred calories.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to compute
amount
of nitrogen in
food</div>

<p>The table also states that milk has a
nitrogen factor of .8. Therefore, if we
wish to know the amount of
nitrogen in the two quarts of
milk, all we need do is to
multiply the number <span class="u">of</span> vienos by the
nitrogen factor; 12 x .8 = 9.6, which figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
represents the nitrogen consumption expressed
in grams. (See explanation of
fourth column of table.) These results
are practically the same as those obtained
by the old system of computation,
but expressed in simpler terms. Thus we
see that the vieno system of computing
food values is unique in its simplicity,
and will be a very material aid in putting
Food Science on a practical basis.</p>


<p class="p2">NECESSITY FOR A SIMPLE SYSTEM</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neither volume
nor weight are
correct standards
for measuring
food
values</div>

<p>Things are commonly measured by
volume, or by weight. That volume
could not be made sufficiently
accurate in the measurement
of food values is
evident. A bushel of lettuce
leaves would contain much
less food value than a bushel of wheat.
Weight would seem to be a fairer way to
compare foods, but all foods contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
water, which may vary from five to
ninety-five per cent. A pound of turnips,
which is nine-tenths water, would
not be comparable with sugar, which has
scarcely any water.</p>

<p>Even if it were not for the water,
weight would not be a fair method of
comparison because some foods are of
more value per pound than others, owing
to their difference in chemical composition.
For instance, a pound of butter
gives about two and one-fourth times
as much heat to the body as sugar.</p>

<p>As before mentioned, the two chief
food factors which we ought to measure
are energy-producing and tissue-building
power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What constitutes
a true
food</div>

<p>All true foods when assimilated in the
body produce some energy. In fact,
only such substances as produce
bodily energy, when
combined with the oxygen
taken in through the lungs, can be
correctly termed food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span></p>

<p>I have taken this energy-producing
power of food as the best basis for measurement
and comparison. The nitrogen
could have been taken as a unit, and the
energy figured by a table, but it is simpler
to use energy as a unit (as given in column
3, p. <a href="#Page_655">655</a>), and figure the nitrogen in the
various foods by means of a table which
gives the amount of nitrogen per unit of
energy. (Column 4, p. <a href="#Page_655">655</a>.)</p>

<p>Multiplication of units of energy (column
3) by the nitrogen factor (column 4)
is necessary because the ratio of nitrogen
to energy is different in each food.</p>


<p class="p2">EXPLANATION OF TABLE</p>

<p>In the table that follows, I have attempted
to give in the simplest way the
amount of each particular food that one
vieno equals.</p>

<p>The second column shows, in the plainest
language possible, what one vieno of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
food equals&mdash;as, one vieno of barley
equals one ounce; or, one vieno of nuts
equals one rounded tablespoonful, etc.
This method is, of course, only approximate,
as in some foods it is impossible to
find a simple term to express the amount
of one vieno. This is especially true of
cooked foods because of the varied
amounts of water contained. In such
cases the way for the student to become
familiar with a vieno is to weigh one
pound of the raw material, and, after it
is cooked, weigh it again, and then
calculate the water content.</p>

<p>The definition given in the second
column in the case of milk, butter, eggs,
and cheese is fairly accurate. The description
given in the case of cereals and
bread is also fairly accurate. In the list
of fresh vegetables, no attempt has been
made to describe one vieno by volume,
as, vegetables being loose and bulky,
it is practical to measure them only by
weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Only the edible
portion of
food considered</div>

<p>In the case of fresh fruits, one vieno
has been defined as "one large orange" or
"six plums," etc. In such
cases allowance for the non-edible
portion has been
made; all weights given in the table
consider only the edible portion.</p>

<p>In the case of nuts, the definition of a
vieno in so many spoonfuls is fairly
accurate. This is done only as an illustration,
and not continued throughout
the table. The student should use only
the second column of the table for rough
work, and to help him figure the approximate
amount of one vieno.</p>

<p>The third column of the table, which
gives the number of vienos or the amount
of heat-energy in one pound, is the
column to which the student should refer
in his work. A pound of food referred to
in this column invariably means one
pound of the edible portion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Simple method
of reducing
food to vienos</div>

<p>The way for the student to calculate
the amount of food in one vieno is to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
a pound of the food that he is to use and
divide it equally into as many portions as
the number in the third column.
For example: If one
pound of wheat is given as
equal to sixteen vienos, the student
should weigh a pound of wheat and divide
it into sixteen portions, and each of these
portions will equal one vieno.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nitrogen
factor simplified</div>

<p>The fourth column of the table gives
the approximate nitrogen factor; that is,
the percentage of nitrogen
by weight in one vieno. This
column is to be used for
computing the amount of nitrogen in the
diet under all ordinary circumstances.
The student should take the total number
of vienos of each food and multiply this
number by the nitrogen factor. The
product will be the approximate amount
of the nitrogen consumed, expressed in
grams. <em>This is the direct method of ascertaining
the amount of available nitrogen in
food.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grams reduced
to vienos</div>

<p>If in reading other works, the student
finds the amount of nitrogen given in
decigrams, he needs only to
divide by ten in order to
reduce it to this system, as a
decigram is one-tenth of a gram. Likewise,
protein can be reduced to grams,
or decigrams, by a simple process of
multiplication and division, as follows:
Sixty grams of protein contains practically
ten grams (one hundred decigrams)
of nitrogen. Divide the amount of
protein by six to change protein to the
nitrogen unit. That is (Protein ÷ 6) =
amount of nitrogen in grams.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned food table gave the
amount of protein in per cent by weight,
making it necessary to weigh the food,
figure the amount of protein by multiplying
the weight by the per cent, and then
reducing this according to the rule given
above. I explain this so that the student
may be able to compare results expressed
in the old table, with the vieno method,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
but in all practical work the student
should use only this <em>direct</em> method which
is much more simple and accurate.</p>

<p>The fifth column of the table gives the
weight of one vieno in grams. This adds
no new information, but only gives the
weight of one vieno in the metric system.
It should be used by those who wish to be
accurate in their work, or by those who
take a scientific interest in their dietary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Examples for
the student
who desires to
be exact</div>

<p>The last column of the table gives the
actual amount of nitrogen in one vieno
of food expressed in grams.
This is the accurate figure
from which the approximate
nitrogen factor for ordinary use has been
derived. For example: The actual
amount of nitrogen in one vieno of
chestnuts is .396. If this number is
multiplied by the number of vienos of
chestnuts eaten, we would have the actual
number of grams of nitrogen consumed.
Suppose ten vienos of chestnuts are
eaten; we would multiply .396 by ten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
which would give us 3.96 grams of nitrogen.
For ordinary purposes, I use the
nearest decimal, which is .4, and which
I give in the fourth column as the nitrogen
factor. Those who wish to figure the
nitrogen with scientific accuracy should
use the figures given in the last column
of the table, as in the example I have
given.</p>

<p>The Vieno system of food measurement
is new, and is intended to give to
the practitioner and to the housewife the
greatest aid in balancing or proportioning
the diet. I have therefore included in
the following tables, all classes of foods,
many of which I do not recommend or
use in my scientific work.</p>

<p class="p1">INTRODUCTION</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scientific eating
leads toward
simplicity</div>

<p>Scientific eating consists in selecting
the food the body requires according to
age, occupation, and climate.
These requirements can be
supplied with a very few
articles. The necessary changes in diet
can always be made by varying the proportions.
It is possible to select, for each
of the four seasons of the year, three or
four articles that will contain all the
elements of nourishment the body needs,
therefore true food science leads one
inevitably toward the mono-diet plan;
that is, making a meal of only one kind
of food. Owing to our inherent desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
to sit at the "groaning table" we may yet
be a long distance from the mono-diet
plan, but the science of human nutrition
points with unerring certainty toward
simplicity. It should be remembered,
however, that one may eat, under nearly
all conditions except extreme superacidity
all he desires of one or two things&mdash;one
preferred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How foods become
curative</div>

<p>In the light of modern medicine, no
food has any specific curative property.
Foods become curative only
as they remove abnormal
conditions, and they will remove
abnormal conditions just to the
extent that they can be perfectly digested
and assimilated, and to the extent that
waste matter is thoroughly eliminated
from the body. In this way all possible
resistance is removed, and Nature will
build up the dis-eased and broken-down
tissue in obedience to the law of animal
evolution. This constructive process we
call "curing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span></p>

<p>While the menus for each season of the
year may seem to vary but little, especially
when compared with the conventional
omnivorous diet, yet experience
has proved that the fewer the articles
composing the meal, the better will be
the results.</p>


<p class="p1b">COOKING</p>

<p class="p2">SOME IMPORTANT FACTS REVEALED BY
MODERN SCIENCE</p>

<p>The object of cooking is to tear down
the cell-structure of foods, and to make
them more digestible. After the cell-structure
is demolished, every degree of
heat to which foods are subjected injures
the foods instead of improving them.</p>


<p class="p2">GRAINS</p>

<p>Grains should be cooked whole. They
should be cleansed, well covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
water, and boiled until the grains burst
open as in making old-fashioned corn
hominy. This will often take from three
to four hours' constant boiling.</p>

<p>Cereals prepared in this way are more
delicious, more nourishing, and far more
healthful than any of the prepared or
patented "breakfast foods," while the
cost is perhaps about one-eighth or one-tenth
of that of the popular patented
products.</p>


<p class="p2">VEGETABLES</p>

<p>The old or popular method of cooking
vegetables is to cover them generously
with water and to boil them much longer
than is necessary, then to drain off the
water, season, and serve. By this process
the mineral salts, in many cases the most
valuable part of the food, are dissolved,
passed into the water, and lost. In this
way many excellent articles of food are
greatly impoverished and reduced perhaps
50 per cent in nutritive value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span></p>

<p>The time vegetables are cooked should
be measured by their solidity. As an
example, spinach can be thoroughly
cooked in about fifteen minutes. In this
way some of its elements are volatilized,
giving it a delicious flavor and taste,
while if cooked in an abundance of water,
from half to three-quarters of an hour,
which is the customary way, its best
nutritive elements are lost by draining
away the water, and it is rendered
almost tasteless.</p>


<p class="p2">COOKING EN CASSEROLE</p>

<p>All succulent and watery vegetables
such as cabbage and spinach, beans,
carrots, onions, parsnips, peas, squash,
turnips, etc., should be cooked in a
casserole dish.</p>

<p>Prepare vegetables in the usual manner
as for boiling. A few tablespoonfuls of
water may be added to such articles as
green beans and peas, beets, carrots,
cauliflower, onions, parsnips, etc. Cover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
and place in an ordinary baking oven
until the vegetable is thoroughly cooked
or softened. In this way vegetables
in reality are cooked in their own juices,
rendered much softer, more digestible,
more delicious, and all their mineral
salts and other nutritive elements are
preserved, making them also more
nutritious.</p>


<p class="p2">RICE AND MACARONI</p>

<p>Rice, macaroni, and spaghetti are exceptions
to the above rules. They should
be cooked in an abundance of water and
thoroughly drained. In this way the
excess of starch which they contain is
disposed of, and their nutritive elements
are better balanced. They are also
rendered much more palatable and
digestible.</p>


<p class="p2">FRUITS</p>

<p>If fruits can be obtained thoroughly
ripe, they should never be cooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span></p>

<p>Dried or evaporated fruits can be
prepared for the table by soaking them
thoroughly in plain water for a few
hours, or over night. In this way the
green and inferior pieces are exposed and
can be discarded. The excess of water
can be boiled down to a sirup and poured
over the fruit. In this way the fruit-sugar
is developed, and sweetening with
cane-sugar becomes unnecessary.</p>

<p>Soaking as above described is merely
a process of putting back into the fruit
the water that was taken out of it by
evaporation or dehydration.</p>

<p>It is evident that that part of the fruit
which will not soften sufficiently by
soaking, to become palatable, was not
ripe enough for food.</p>


<p class="p2">CANNED FOODS</p>

<p>The average table, especially hotels
and restaurants, are supplied largely
from canned foods. A process of perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
preservation of foods has never been
invented and probably never will be.
No matter how well foods may taste,
they undergo constant chemical changes
from the time they leave the ground or
parent stalk until they are thoroughly
decomposed. All vegetables, therefore,
should be used fresh, if possible.</p>


<p class="p2">BUTTERMILK</p>

<p>An excellent quality of buttermilk may
be made as follows: Allow sweet milk to
stand (well covered) in a warm room
until it thickens or coagulates; whip with
an ordinary rotary egg beater without
removing the cream.</p>


<p class="p2">HOME-MADE BUTTER</p>

<p>Sweet butter may be made in a few
minutes from ordinary cream by placing
it in a deep bowl and whipping with a
rotary egg beater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1b">SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE SELECTION<br />
AND THE PREPARATION OF CERTAIN<br />
ARTICLES MENTIONED IN<br />
THE MENUS</p>


<p class="p2">THE BANANA</p>

<p>The banana is a vegetable. It is one
of our most valuable foods, as well as the
most prolific. It will produce more food
per acre, with less care and labor, than
any other plant that grows.</p>

<p>While the banana grows only in the
tropical countries, it is equally as good
and useful to people of the northern
zones.</p>

<p>Bananas that are transported to the
North are cut green, and often immature;
that is, before they have attained their
full growth. This latter variety should
never be used. In their green and unripened
state, they are wholly unfit for
food, and for these reasons there has
arisen a broadcast prejudice against this
most excellent article of diet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">HOW TO SELECT AND RIPEN BANANAS</p>

<p>Care should be exercised to select the
largest variety&mdash;only those that have
attained their full growth on the parent
tree. If bananas cannot be procured
"dead ripe" from the dealer, they should
be purchased, if possible, by the bunch,
or a few of the lower "hands" can be
purchased and left on the stalk. They
should be kept in the open air (that is,
uncovered), in an even, warm temperature,
and the end of the stalk covered
with a clean white cloth, or immersed
in water, kept fresh by changing daily.
In this way the banana will mature,
ripen slowly, and be almost as delicious
as if obtained ripe from its
native tree.</p>

<p>Bananas should not be eaten until they
are "dead ripe"&mdash;black spotted. In this
state, the carbohydrates which they
contain are as readily digestible as fresh
milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">BAKED BANANAS</p>

<p>Peel large ripe bananas; bake in an
open pan in a very hot oven from ten to
fifteen minutes, or until slightly brown.</p>

<p>Baked bananas make a delicious dessert
served with either of the following:</p>

<blockquote><p class="p5">a <span class="smcap">Cream</span></p>
<p class="p5">b <span class="smcap">Nut Butter</span></p>
<p class="p5">c <span class="smcap">Dairy Butter</span></p>
<p class="p5">d <span class="smcap">Both dairy butter and a sauce made by<br />
gradually diluting nut butter with a<br />
little water, until a smooth paste is<br />
formed</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Bananas need much mastication, not
for the purpose of reduction, but for the
purpose of insalivation.</p>


<h3>RECIPES</h3>


<p class="p2">RECIPE FOR CODDLED EGG</p>

<p>Place an egg in a pint cup; cover with
boiling water and allow to stand, covered,
five or six minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">RECIPE FOR UNCOOKED EGGS</p>

<p>Break the number desired into a narrow
bowl; add a teaspoonful of sugar to each
egg, and a pinch of salt; whip <em>very briskly</em>
with a rotary egg beater from five to
eight minutes.</p>

<p>To each egg a teaspoonful of lemon
juice and half a glass of milk may then be
slowly whipped into the mixture, if
desired.</p>


<p class="p2">RECIPE FOR BAKED OMELET</p>

<p>Whip two eggs very thoroughly for
about five minutes; add a dash of salt, a
dessert-spoonful each of corn-starch and
of heavy cream. Bake very lightly in a
small pan.</p>


<p class="p2">FISH AND FOWL<br />
SELECTION AND PREPARATION</p>

<p>If we must eat the flesh of animals the
young should be selected. It contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
more digestible protein, especially albumin,
than the old or matured animal,
and has had less time in which to become
contaminated by unhygienic habits.
Both fish and fowl should be baked,
boiled, or broiled; never fried.</p>


<p class="p2">RECIPE FOR PREPARING GREEN PEAS
IN THE POD</p>

<p>After thoroughly cleansing the desired
amount of fresh tender peas, unshelled,
put them into a covered pot or casserole
dish; add a few spoonfuls of water, a
little butter and salt, and cook slowly
until thoroughly softened; serve in the
pod.</p>

<p>The peas may be eaten by placing the
pod between the teeth, and then giving
it a gentle pull. This strips off the outer
coating or pulp, leaving only the thin
film of cellulose.</p>

<p>NOTE: The pea pulp, or substance
upon the pod, is rich in mineral salts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
highly nutritious, slightly laxative, and
an excellent aid in the digestion of other
foods. It is a better balanced and a
more valuable food than the pea.</p>


<p class="p2">PUMPKIN</p>

<p>Pumpkin may be made very delicious
by stewing or boiling in just enough water
to prevent burning. Mash well and put
through a colander. Season and serve
same as squash, or, prepare as directed,
and bake until slightly brown.</p>


<p class="p2">VEGETABLE JUICE</p>

<p>Chop fine and boil carrots, peas, asparagus,
or any other fresh vegetable from
eight to ten minutes in sufficient water
to make the amount of juice required;
strain and serve.</p>

<p>The tender parts of the fresh vegetable
may be thoroughly cooked, put through
a colander, and served as a purée.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">HOW TO MAKE SASSAFRAS TEA</p>

<p>Crush the bark of the red sassafras
root, allowing a piece as large as a silver
dime to each cup. Add the quantity of
water desired; simmer from five to ten
minutes. Drink with cream and sugar.</p>


<p class="p2">WHEAT BRAN</p>

<p>Wheat bran is the outer coating of the
wheat grain. Chemically, it is pure
cellulose, which is insoluble and indigestible
in the ordinary digestive solvents
of the body.</p>

<p>Wheat bran serves a valuable medicinal
purpose in the stomach and in the alimentary
tract. When introduced into
the stomach, its cell structure fills with
water, and it increases from four to eight
times its size in its dry state. It excites
both stomach and intestinal peristalsis,
thereby preventing stomach indigestion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
and by carrying the water along down the
intestinal tract, it prevents intestinal
congestion, or what is commonly called
constipation. Wheat bran may be properly
called an intestinal broom or cleansing
agent.</p>

<p>Man, in the process of preparing his
food, has invented expensive and complicated
machinery for removing all cellulose
and roughness from his diet. He has
suffered both stomach and intestinal
congestion just to the extent that this
refining process has been carried on.
Bran puts back into the diet not only
what modern milling methods have taken
out of it, but that which civilized habits
of refining have eliminated from our
food. It therefore naturalizes the
diet, promotes digestion, cleanses the
mucous surfaces of both the stomach
and the intestines, and prevents congestion
in the ascending colon, which
is the primary cause of appendicitis, so
called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">BRAN MEAL</p>

<p>Bran meal is the product of the entire
wheat, ground coarsely, and mixed with
a certain per cent of wheat bran. It
makes an excellent bread.</p>

<p>Bread made from bran meal acts on
the digestive and the alimentary organs,
the same as the pure bran, only in a
milder capacity. It also aids the stomach
in the digestion of other foods. It is more
nourishing than wheat flour, for the reason
that it is better balanced, containing
all the carbohydrate and the proteid
elements of the grain.</p>

<p>Bread made from bran meal is better
in the form of gems baked in small gem
rings.</p>

<p>This meal requires neither baking powder
nor soda, and should not be sifted.</p>


<h3>CHOICE OF MENUS</h3>

may be exercised, but whichever menu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
is chosen, it should be taken in its entirety.
In other words, do not select
articles from one menu and combine them
with articles mentioned in another menu.
Neither should any article of food be
eaten with a particular menu, other than
that which is mentioned therein. By
observing these suggestions, the proper
combinations of food are observed, which
is equally as important as the selections.</p>

<p>NOTE: In this volume there are some
menus which contain combinations of
food classed as No. 3 in Lesson XII,
"Tables of Digestive Harmonies and
Disharmonies," pp. <a href="#Page_609">609</a> to <a href="#Page_617">617</a> inclusive.
This is explained by the fact that said
"tables" are laid out for the normal person,
while the menus were prescribed for
the treatment of some special disorder,
or for the purpose of removing some
offending causes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span></p>


<h3>NORMAL MENUS</h3>

<p>The following menus are intended for
those possessing normal digestion and
assimilation of food; that is, for those
having no digestive disorders.</p>


<p class="p2">INTRODUCTION TO NORMAL MENUS</p>

<p>While a majority of the menus composing
this volume were prescribed for
the purpose of removing the causes of
some specific disorder, a vast number of
those treated remained under the care
of the author long after they had become
normal or cured, as the transition from
dis-ease to health is usually termed.</p>

<p>Another large number of comparatively
healthy persons, recognizing the relation
between diet and health, came under the
care of the writer for the purpose of
having their diet selected, proportioned,
and balanced according to age, occupation,
and the season of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span></p>

<p>The excellent results that were obtained,
in nearly all such cases, emphasized
the importance of giving a set of
normal menus for normal people. All
the following menus have been tested,
under the direction of the author, and
have been chosen because they gave
the desired results.</p>

<h3>CURATIVE MENUS</h3>

<p class="p1b">INTRODUCTION TO CURATIVE MENUS</p>

<p>Scientific investigation leads one inevitably
to the conclusion that a vast
number of so-called dis-eases are caused
by errors in eating; that is, by wrong
selections, wrong combinations and
wrong proportions of food. (See chart,
Vol. I, p. 9, showing the number of
dis-eases caused by superacidity.) This
chart will give the reader some idea of
the number of disorders that may originate
from one source or from one fundamental
cause.</p>

<p>While superacidity is a true dis-ease,
and may cause all the disorders shown
on this chart, yet behind superacidity
there is a parent cause, namely, wrong
eating. In the light of these facts, it is
obvious that a department of curative
and remedial menus should constitute an
important feature of this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span></p>

<p>For each patient who came under the
care of the author (over 23,000 in all),
there was prescribed an average of six
menus, covering a period of six weeks.
Each patient was required to keep an
accurate record of his or her diet, and
the symptoms that developed after each
meal. This record was either brought to
the author in person, or sent to him
through the mails.</p>

<p>From this vast amount of data and
clinical experience, the writer was enabled
to select all the menus composing
this volume, from those that had proved
successful in the various disorders treated.
This volume, therefore, is composed of
only such menus as gave the desired
results. It represents the refined experience
of twenty years' active practise
in Scientific Feeding.</p>

<h3>MENUS FOR SUPERACIDITY</h3>


<p class="p1b">SPRING MENU</p>

<p class="center"><em>ABNORMAL APPETITE</em><br />
<em>SUPERACIDITY</em></p>

<p>Abnormal appetite is caused by the
surplus acid which is left in the stomach
after digestion has taken place. This
surplus acid causes irritation of the mucous
membrane of both the stomach and
the pylorus. The supersecretion of acid,
in turn, is caused by overeating, by taking
foods in combination which are chemically
inharmonious, by sedative and
intoxicating beverages, by tobacco, and
by all stimulating drugs. The logical
remedy, therefore, is to omit the use of
these things, and to regulate the diet
according to age, occupation, and chemistry,
and to drink copiously of water
both at meals and between meals.</p>

<p class="p2b"><em>STOMACH AND INTESTINAL CATARRH</em></p>

<p>Catarrh of the stomach is merely a form
of chronic irritation caused by a residue
of hydrochloric acid in the stomach
following the process of digestion. This
condition is augmented by intoxicating
and stimulating beverages&mdash;tobacco,
liquor, beer, tea, coffee; by acids, such as
vinegar, lemon, grapefruit, and pineapple
juices; by cane-sugar, cereal starches,
and meat. The remedy, therefore, is
found in eliminating these things, and
in confining the diet to the following
foods:</p>

the amount herein prescribed. The combination,
however, should be observed.</p>

<p>The emergency luncheon is to be taken
if one does not like the regular luncheon.
The same rule should be observed with
the emergency dinner. The regular
luncheon contains considerable protein,
which is very necessary in these conditions.
The emergency dinner contains
the same in another form. The one may
be chosen which appeals most to natural
hunger.</p>

<p>Now and then the breakfast may consist
of one or two extremely ripe bananas,
eaten with nut butter and cream, and
one or two whipped eggs.</p>

<p>The above menus are the minimum of
food for this condition. The quantity
may be increased according to the demands
of normal hunger. Hunger, however,
should be determined by labor or
exercise. Abnormal appetite, caused by
supersecretion of acid in the stomach, is
very often mistaken for hunger. In such
cases, the patient should cease eating
before the appetite is satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[807]</a></span></p>


<hr class="tb" />

<h3>INDIGESTION (ACUTE)</h3>

<p>In nearly all cases of acute indigestion,
food should be omitted. The patient
should be given hot water morning, noon,
and evening, and, if possible, a stomach
tube should be inserted, and the hot
water and stomach contents removed.
If this cannot be done, the patient
should drink copiously of hot water,
and vomit as much of it as possible.
After the stomach has been cleansed, a
cup of coarse wheat bran, or a large
bunch of Concord or blue grapes may
be given (if they are in season), swallowing
skins, seeds, and pulp. Both bran
and grapes are preferable to laxative
medicines, and much more effective.
The high enema should be administered,
thus removing the contents of the lower
bowels. After the stomach and the bowels
have been thoroughly cleansed, if the
patient is not able to exercise, artificial
manipulation of the abdomen should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[808]</a></span>
administered for a period of half an hour
three times a day. These suggestions
may be repeated until the patient is
relieved, when the diet for chronic indigestion
may be followed in rather
modified form, omitting the heavier vegetables,
and increasing the lighter foods.</p>

<h3>MENUS FOR BILIOUSNESS</h3>

<p class="p1b">SPRING MENU</p>

<p class="p2b"><em>BILIOUSNESS&mdash;HEADACHE
SLUGGISH LIVER</em></p>

<p>Supersecretion of bile by the liver is
termed biliousness. This may be expressed
by the presence of bile in the
stomach, which usually causes headache,
beginning at the base of the brain, and
after five or six hours settling over the
eyes. This is sometimes associated with
nausea or sick headache.</p>

<p>Again, the excess of bile is absorbed
into the blood, causing the skin to become
yellow and spotted, and sometimes it
assumes the appearance of jaundice.</p>

<p>Biliousness is caused by taking an excess
of sweets, coffee, liquors, fats, and
sometimes starches&mdash;cereal, bread, etc.
The remedy, therefore, is a very simple
one, and largely confined to elimination,
vigorous exercise, deep breathing, and
copious drinking of water.</p>

<p>The following menus are suggestive.
The diet may consist of any group of
fresh, natural foods which are in season.</p>

<h3>MENUS FOR CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER</h3>

<p class="p1b"><em>CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER</em></p>

<p>Cirrhosis is a word derived from the
Greek meaning <em>yellow</em>. It was originally
intended to convey the idea of over-growth
or enlargement of this much-abused
organ, but inasmuch as atrophic
conditions often show yellow or tawny,
there are now two kinds of cirrhosis,
namely, atrophic cirrhosis, meaning a
shrinkage, and hypertrophic cirrhosis,
meaning enlargement of the liver.</p>

<p>Atrophic cirrhosis is caused by alcoholism,
often augmented by milder stimulants
such as tea and coffee.</p>

<p>Hypertrophic cirrhosis is caused by
overeating, especially of meat, sweets,
and starchy foods.</p>

<p>The causes of the former should be
removed by ceasing the use of tea, coffee,
and all alcoholic stimulants, and of the
latter by omitting sweets, and limiting
the diet in quantity to, or in severe cases
below, the actual needs of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[823]</a></span></p>

<p>The following menus are laid out for
the treatment of severe cases. They are
designed both as a counteractive and as
a remedial measure.</p>

<p>In mild cases, or as the patient recovers,
the diet may be increased in quantity,
but it should be confined very rigidly to
the articles named in the list below, and
in the menus which follow.</p>

<p>Foods to be used in the treatment of
cirrhosis of the liver:</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
